# LODES_OD_hotspot

Goal: Visualize the number of workers in each censustract in South East Michigan and their origins

Based on 2015 LODES data (https://lehd.ces.census.gov/data/) I created a clickable shiny application that shows on a map how many people work in each censustract. By clicking on the census tract, the user can see hotspots the workers commute from.

Download the folder with all the files and run the file "app.R" in R-Studio, setting the working directory to the folder. It might take a while to load the data and display the maps.


Deployed at https://geospatially.shinyapps.io/lodes_od_hotspot/

Details of the hotspot analysis coming soon .....
